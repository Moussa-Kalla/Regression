# Polynomial Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of polynomial regression using synthetic data. The notebook uses Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` to process data, fit a polynomial regression model, and visualize the results.

## Project Structure

- **Data Generation**: Synthetic data points are generated and plotted.
- **Model Fitting**: A polynomial regression model is trained using the `scikit-learn` library.
- **Visualization**: The results are visualized using `matplotlib`, showing both the real data points and the fitted polynomial curve.
- **Error Calculation**: The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moussa-Kalla/polynomial-regression.git
